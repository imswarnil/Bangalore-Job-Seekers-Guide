# Job Seekers Survival Guide – Bangalore Edition 🚀

Once upon a time, I was just like you.

Graduated in 2017 from LNCT, no campus placement, no job, no direction. I was lost, frustrated, and overwhelmed. Everyone said "get a job" but no one told me **how**. I had to figure it all out the hard way — and now that path I carved for myself? It can be a roadmap for you too.

## 📘 About This Project

**Job Seekers Survival Guide** is my personal yet practical guide for freshers, grads, and anyone struggling to get a job in Bangalore or beyond.  
It’s not theory. It’s what I did. It’s what worked. It’s what I wish someone gave me back then.

I’ve packaged my entire journey — mistakes, tips, practical insights, and systems I used to get my first job — into this open-source Jekyll-based project.

You can use this to:

- Build your own version of a job-seeking guide
- Create a blog or microsite to help others
- Share your story, tools, and templates
- Empower job seekers who feel lost like we once did

## 💡 Why I Made This

Because no one tells you what to do when:

- You don’t get a campus placement 😞
- You're the first in your family to pursue tech 👨‍💻
- You're overwhelmed by random LinkedIn advice 🙄
- You're smart, but still stuck

I lived it. I broke out of it. Now I’m sharing the entire map so you don’t have to walk blind.
