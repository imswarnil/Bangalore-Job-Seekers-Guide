## Introduction: My Starting Point

This is my first post since July 1st, 2017. That was the day I officially graduated with a degree in engineering. It was also the day I officially became unemployed.

I am writing this to document my journey. I know there are many people like me in India who might feel lost or sad about their careers. I want to share my story, including my darkest days, to give an idea of what life can look like when things don't go as planned.

This project is for you, and for me. It’s a place to share, to ask questions, and to find a way forward.

### Chapter 1: The Kota Years

#### The Path to Kota

My journey, like many others, started after the 10th grade. The goal was to crack the engineering entrance exams. The place to do that was Kota. I went there to prepare for the AIEEE at Allen.

I remember that time with a certain fondness. I worked very hard. There was an energy and a single-minded focus that I really loved. I was fully dedicated to my studies.

#### The Fading Enthusiasm

Over time, that initial enthusiasm started to fade. The reality of the competition was tough. I came to understand that cracking IIT was not going to happen for me. I still had hope for the AIEEE, thinking I could get into a good NIT.

I gave all the major exams: WBJEE, COMEDK, VITEEE, IIT, and AIEEE. But in the end, my results in those exams were not strong enough to get me into a top college.

The one exam where I did get good marks was the MPPET, the Madhya Pradesh engineering entrance exam.

### Chapter 2: The College Decision

#### Choosing a Path

My MPPET score was good enough to get me into LNCT, a good private college in Bhopal. My elder brother had studied there, and he was the one who convinced my father.

He told my father that if I went to LNCT, I would get a good campus placement and my career would be set. He said I would get a job.

At that time, I didn't have a strong preference for any particular branch of engineering. My father said I should take Computer Science Engineering (CSE). I had wanted to go to VIT, but I knew my family was poor and we couldn't afford the fees. So, I agreed and took admission in CSE at LNCT Bhopal.

#### A New Kind of Life

My academic downfall, which had started after the 10th grade, continued in college. Instead of focusing on my career, I started enjoying life in other ways.

I was not a good student. I spent my time playing snooker, staying out late with friends, and sleeping late in the mornings. I was living a life that was completely disconnected from my engineering studies. I never really liked coding.

#### A Different Passion

In my third year of college, I discovered something I was truly passionate about. It wasn't related to engineering. I wanted to become a YouTuber.

I loved the art of making videos. I started a channel and it began to grow. This became my new focus. All my energy and attention went into my YouTube channel.

### Chapter 3: The Placement Season

#### The Consequence of My Focus

When the fourth year came, it was time for campus placements. Because my focus had been entirely on YouTube, I was not prepared. While my classmates were preparing for technical interviews, I was working on my videos.

The result was predictable. I appeared for interviews with many companies:
- Cognizant
- Wipro
- Tata Technologies
- Tech Mahindra
- L&T
- Amdocs

I failed in all of them.

The placement season ended. My friends had jobs. I did not.

### Chapter 4: After Graduation

#### Returning Home

After finishing college, I returned home. I was a graduate, but I was jobless. My father could have spent more money on me for further studies or courses, but the problem was my lack of focus and direction.

This was the beginning of the darkest days of my life. I felt lost and sad.

#### The Reason for This Project

I am starting this project now because I know my story is not unique. There are many people like me in India. I want to document my journey from this point on.

Maybe by sharing my story, I can give someone else an idea of what this situation feels like. Maybe it can provide some inspiration, or at least a sense of relativity—the knowledge that you are not alone.

This portal is a place where you can always ask questions. My promise is that no question will go unanswered. This was my first post, an introduction to my story. Thank you for reading.
