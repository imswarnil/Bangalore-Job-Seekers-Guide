## Welcome to the Bangalore Job Seekers Guide

Hello everyone, and welcome to the first official post of this project.

My name is Swarnil. Before we dive into guides, tips, and resources, I believe it’s important to start at the very beginning. Every project has a "why" – a reason it exists. The "why" behind this project is my own personal story. It’s a story of failure, of feeling lost, and of the determination to build something useful out of a difficult experience.

This post is the foundation of the **Bangalore Job Seekers Guide**. It is the context for everything that will follow.

*Every big project starts with a small seed. This story is the seed for this guide.*

### Chapter 1: The Starting Point - Kota

My journey is one that many students in India will recognize. After my 10th-grade exams, the path laid out for me was clear: prepare for engineering entrance exams. For this, I went to Kota and joined Allen to prepare for the AIEEE.

#### The Initial Hope and Hard Work

I want to be clear: I truly loved that time in the beginning. There was a powerful sense of purpose. I was filled with enthusiasm and I studied very hard. My life was completely dedicated to my studies, and I was hopeful that this hard work would lead to a great result.

#### The Reality Check

However, as time went on, the intense pressure and competition took a toll. My initial enthusiasm faded. I began to realize that getting into a top-tier college like an IIT or NIT through the AIEEE was not going to happen for me.

I appeared for many entrance exams, including WBJEE, COMEDK, and VITEEE, but my performance was not strong enough. My only good score came from the MPPET, the state-level entrance exam for Madhya Pradesh. This result would decide the next four years of my life.

### Chapter 2: The College Years and the Shift in Focus

With my MPPET score, I secured admission at LNCT, a good private college in Bhopal.

#### The Path Chosen for Me

My elder brother, an alumnus of LNCT, was confident in this path. He convinced my father that the college had a good track record for campus placements, and that I would secure a job.

I personally had a desire to study at VIT, but I knew my family was poor and could not manage the high fees. My father suggested I take Computer Science Engineering (CSE). Without a strong preference of my own, I agreed to his decision.

#### The Distractions and a New Passion

My academic performance, which had already started to decline after the 10th grade, did not improve in college. I found it very difficult to develop an interest in coding, and I was not a good student.

My focus shifted completely away from my career. I spent my time playing snooker and roaming with friends late at night. Instead of focusing on my studies, I was just enjoying the freedom of college life.

In my third year, I discovered a new passion: becoming a YouTuber. I was fascinated by the art of making videos, and I started my own channel. It began to grow, and this became my new focus. All of my energy and attention, which should have been on my engineering degree, was now on my YouTube channel.

*My focus was divided, and this had major consequences.*

### Chapter 3: The Result: Failure in Placements

The final year of college is defined by campus placements. This is the period when companies hire students directly from the college.

#### The Consequence of Being Unprepared

Because my focus was entirely on YouTube, I was not prepared for this crucial phase. While my classmates were studying hard for technical interviews, I was not.

I appeared for placements in many companies, including major ones like:
- Cognizant
- Wipro
- Tata Technologies
- Tech Mahindra
- L&T
- Amdocs

I failed in all of them. The results were a direct reflection of my lack of preparation. When the placement season ended, my friends had job offers. I did not.

### Chapter 4: The Aftermath and the Mission of This Project

On July 1st, 2017, I officially graduated. I had an engineering degree, but I was jobless.

#### The Darkest Days

The period after I returned home was the beginning of the darkest days of my life. I felt deeply sad and completely lost. I knew my father could have spent more money on me for further courses, but the root problem was my own lack of direction.

*This is how I felt: with no clear direction to follow.*

### The Purpose of the 'Bangalore Job Seekers Guide'

It was from this difficult and painful experience that the idea for this project was born. I realized that my story is not just mine alone; many people in India face a similar situation.

This is the mission of this project:

- **To Be a Real-World Guide:** I want to document my own journey as I work to build my career. I plan to move to Bangalore, a city full of job seekers, and share every step of my experience. This guide will be honest, practical, and based on real life.
- **To Build a Community:** This project is for everyone who feels lost. It is a place to find inspiration, get ideas, and most importantly, to know that you are not alone.
- **To Be a Platform for Help:** This is a portal where questions are encouraged. My promise is that I will ensure no question goes unanswered. We can help each other navigate the difficult path of finding a job.

My failure has given me a new purpose. This project is the first step in fulfilling that purpose. Thank you for reading the story that started it all.

Welcome, once again, to the Bangalore Job Seekers Guide. Let's begin this journey.
