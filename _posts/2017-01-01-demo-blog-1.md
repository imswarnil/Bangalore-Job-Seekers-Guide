## To Anyone Who Feels Lost, This Is for You

My name is Swarnil, and I want to tell you a story. It’s not a story you’ll see in a movie, and it doesn't have a perfect, happy ending... yet. It’s a real story about failure. It’s about the heavy silence you feel when everyone around you is celebrating their success. It's about what happens when you follow the map everyone gives you, only to find yourself completely lost in the wilderness.

I am sharing this because if you are reading this, there is a chance you might feel a little lost too. Maybe you are a student worried about your future. Maybe you are a recent graduate sitting at home, with a degree in your hand but no offer letter. Maybe you are tired of hearing, "So, what's next?" from well-meaning relatives.

If that sounds like you, then please know, you are not alone. I have been there. This is my story, and it is the reason I am building the **Bangalore Job Seekers Guide**.

*Sometimes, the most important journeys are the ones you have to start alone.*

## Chapter 1: The Kota Promise

Our journey often begins not with our own dream, but with the dreams of our parents. My journey was no different. After my 10th grade, the path was clear: Kota. The promise was simple: "Work hard for two years, get into a good engineering college, and your life will be set."

### A Boy Full of Hope

I went to Kota with a heart full of hope. I joined Allen to prepare for the AIEEE. In the beginning, I embraced the struggle. I loved the discipline, the long hours of study, the feeling that I was building a foundation for a great future. I truly believed in the system. I thought this was the only way.

### The Cracks in the Dream

But the Kota system is like a high-pressure machine. It finds the strongest parts and discards the rest. Slowly, I started to feel like one of the parts that couldn't handle the pressure. The weekly tests, the public ranking, the constant feeling of not being good enough—it started to break my spirit.

My dream of getting into an IIT shattered. My hope for an NIT also faded away after the AIEEE results. I had given all the major exams—WBJEE, COMEDK, VITEEE—but my performance was not up to the mark. My only decent score came from the MPPET, the state-level exam. It was my only option, my last chance.

It was my first real taste of failure, and it taught me a hard lesson: **You can work hard, but if you're on the wrong track for you, you will only get tired.**

## Chapter 2: The College Years: A Story of Lost Focus

My MPPET score got me a seat in CSE at LNCT, a private college in Bhopal. My family was relieved. My elder brother had studied there, and he assured my father, "Don't worry, he will get a job from campus placement." That sentence became the expectation for the next four years of my life.

### The Illusion of Freedom

After the strict environment of Kota, college felt like an open playground. There were no teachers chasing me, no daily pressure. I was free. But I was not mature enough to handle that freedom.

I found it hard to like coding. It felt like a puzzle I could never solve. So, instead of trying harder, I gave up. I found comfort in other things. My life became a cycle of late-night snooker games, roaming around with friends, and sleeping through morning classes. I was physically present in the college, but my mind was a million miles away from engineering.

I was running away from my responsibility, and I didn't even realize it.

### A New, Misleading Passion

In my third year, I found something that made me feel alive: YouTube. I fell in love with creating videos. It was a world where I felt smart, creative, and in control. I started a channel, and as it grew, so did my confidence. I thought, "This is it. This is my true talent. I don't need engineering."

I poured every ounce of my energy into my channel. I was passionate, dedicated, and hard-working... but for the wrong goal at that time. I was so blinded by this new dream that I completely ignored the degree I was there to earn. This was my biggest mistake. I learned that **passion without a plan is just a hobby.**

## Chapter 3: The Day of Judgment: Placement Season

The final year of college is not about friendship or fun. It's about one thing: getting a job. The placement season is a battlefield. And I walked onto it without any weapons.

### The Empty Resume

While my friends were preparing day and night, practicing coding, and building projects, I was editing my next video. I appeared for interviews with all the big companies—Cognizant, Wipro, Tata Technologies, Tech Mahindra, L&T, Amdocs.

In every interview, I was asked questions I couldn't answer. My technical knowledge was zero. The interviewers could see that I was not serious. My heart wasn't in it.

One by one, they all rejected me. With every rejection, a little piece of my confidence died. When the placement season was over, my friends had offer letters. They were celebrating their first step into the corporate world.

I had nothing. Just a degree that felt like a certificate of my failure.

## Chapter 4: The Long Walk Home

Returning home without a job was the most difficult walk of my life. The shame was so heavy, it was hard to breathe.

### The Sound of Silence

At home, nobody yelled at me. Nobody blamed me. But the silence was deafening. I could see the disappointment in my father's eyes, even when he smiled. I could feel my family's unspoken worry. I started isolating myself. I would sleep all day just to avoid the sadness in the house.

This was my rock bottom. I was a 21-year-old graduate with no job, no skills, and no direction. I felt like a complete burden on my family. The darkness I felt during this time was overwhelming. I felt completely and utterly alone.

*When you feel lost in the dark, even a small light of hope can show you the way forward.*

### A Spark in the Darkness: The Birth of an Idea

It was in this darkness that a new thought came to my mind. What if I am not alone? What if there are thousands of other students who feel this way? What if my failure could be used for something good?

The pain and shame I felt... I didn't want anyone else to go through it alone.

That is when the idea for the **Bangalore Job Seekers Guide** was born.

This is not just another job portal. This is a mission. It is my determination to turn my biggest failure into a source of strength for others. It is my promise to build a community where no one feels lost or alone in their career journey.

- **This is my 'Why':** My own journey is the reason this project exists. I understand the pain of not having a job, of feeling like a failure. I want to build the resource that I wish I had during my darkest days.
- **This is my Plan:** I will document my own journey to find a job, starting with the move to Bangalore. I will share every detail—the struggles, the small successes, the lessons learned. I will create a guide that is real, honest, and practical.
- **This is my Promise to You:** If you are reading this and you feel lost, this space is for you. This is a community. You can ask anything. You can share your story. And I promise, you will find support here. We will figure this out, together.

My failure did not define me. It gave me a new purpose. My journey did not end on that placement day; it just began. And I invite you to join me. Let's build a path for ourselves, together. Your journey starts now. And you are not walking it alone.
