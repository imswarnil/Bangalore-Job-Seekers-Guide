## Chapter 1: Two Titles, One Day

On July 1st, 2017, I was given two titles. The first was "Engineer," printed on a crisp degree certificate from my college. The second was "Unemployed," a silent label that nobody spoke of, but everyone knew. On the same day, I became a graduate and a jobless man.

This is the story of how I earned both titles. It’s a story about dreams, distractions, and the difficult, quiet journey of finding your way when you feel like you’ve already failed.

### Part I: The Kota Machine

#### The Promise of a Golden Ticket

Like lakhs of other students, my life took a sharp turn after the 10th standard. The destination was Kota, Rajasthan. It was seen as the place where you could get a golden ticket to a bright future—a seat in a top engineering college. My parents, like all parents, wanted the best for me. They put their savings and their hopes on my shoulders and sent me off to an Allen coaching center.

The first few months were exciting. I was away from home, living a new life dedicated to one single goal. Waking up at 5 AM, studying for 14 hours a day, solving endless physics problems—it felt like I was part of a special army. I was working harder than ever before.

> **Lesson #1: Hard work alone is not enough if your heart is not in it.**

Slowly, the excitement faded. The Kota machine is designed to find the best, and I started to see that I was not one of them. The weekly tests, the rank lists, the constant comparison—it all started to wear me down. The dream of IIT became a distant star. I shifted my focus to the AIEEE exam, hoping for a place in a good NIT. But my confidence was already shaken. My results were not good enough.

My only success was in the state-level exam, the MPPET. It was my only ticket out.

#### A Choice Made by Others

My marks were good enough for a private college in Bhopal called LNCT. My elder brother was an alumnus. He was the one who convinced my father. "It is a good college," he said. "He will get a good campus placement for sure. You don’t need to worry."

That one sentence decided the next four years of my life. My father told me to take Computer Science Engineering. Did I want to become a software engineer? I had no idea. I was just a tired 18-year-old boy who had failed to live up to his own expectations. So, I agreed. I took the seat.

### Part II: The Four Years of Freedom

#### Swapping Books for a Billiards Cue

College was a different world. For the first time, there were no weekly tests, no rank lists, no one watching over my shoulder every minute. I was free. And I used that freedom for everything except studying.

The truth is, I never developed a love for coding. The logic felt confusing, and staring at a black screen with white text felt like a punishment. So I found other things to do. My life revolved around the snooker club, late-night chai stalls, and roaming the city with friends. My attendance was low, and my grades were just average. I was passing my exams, but I was not learning anything of value for my future career.

> **Lesson #2: Freedom without discipline is a trap. You can become busy doing nothing important.**

#### Finding a Different Passion

In my third year, something changed. I discovered YouTube. Not just watching it, but creating for it. I was fascinated by the idea of making videos. I saved up and bought a simple camera.

Suddenly, I had a new purpose. I would spend hours learning how to edit videos. I would write scripts, shoot content, and upload it to my channel. I loved the process. It was creative, it was challenging, and it was all mine. My channel started to grow slowly, and with every new subscriber, I felt a sense of achievement that I never got from my engineering subjects.

I told myself this was my true calling. This was what I was meant to do.

### Part III: The Final Reckoning

#### The Placement Season

The final year of college is all about one thing: placements. Companies come to campus, and your entire four years are judged in a 30-minute interview.

My friends were serious. They were solving coding problems on websites like LeetCode and HackerRank. They were creating technical projects to put on their resumes. They were preparing for the final battle.

And me? I was busy editing my latest vlog.

I also sat for the placements. I had to. It was expected. But I was in a different world. In group discussions, while others talked about artificial intelligence, I would be thinking about my video’s thumbnail. In technical interviews, when they asked me about data structures, my mind would drift to my channel’s analytics.

I remember one interviewer asking me, "Where do you see yourself in five years?"

My honest answer would have been, "As a successful YouTuber with a million subscribers." But I couldn't say that. I gave some standard answer about working in their company and growing as a professional. He knew I was not being genuine. I knew it too.

#### The List of Rejections

The rejections came one after another.
- Cognizant
- Wipro
- Tata Technologies
- Tech Mahindra
- L&T
- Amdocs

The list was long. Every time a new list of selected students was put up on the notice board, my name was missing. It was a public failure. Everyone knew.

The season ended. My friends had offer letters. They were planning their new lives in cities like Bangalore and Pune. I had my YouTube channel, which was not making any money, and a degree that suddenly felt very heavy in my hands.

### Part IV: The Silence at Home

#### The Long Train Ride Home

The journey back home after my final exams was the quietest I have ever known. I looked out the window at the passing fields and villages, but I saw nothing. All I could feel was a deep sense of shame. I had been given an opportunity, and I had wasted it. How was I going to face my parents?

> **Lesson #3: The weight of unspoken disappointment is heavier than any failure.**

When I reached home, no one shouted at me. No one blamed me. In some ways, that was worse. My parents tried to act normal. They would smile and talk about other things. But the topic of my future was like a ghost in the room—everyone knew it was there, but no one wanted to talk about it.

The silence was deafening. My friends were starting their new jobs, posting pictures of their offices and new friends. I was at home, sleeping late, avoiding relatives, and feeling more lost than ever before.

#### The Real Beginning

Those first few months at home were my darkest. I had no direction, no confidence, and no idea what to do next. The dream that started in Kota had ended in a silent, empty room in my parents’ house.

It was during this time that I realized something important. My story, as painful as it was, was probably not unique. There must be others like me—other students who felt lost, who felt they had failed, who didn't know what to do next.

And that is where this new journey begins. This is not just a story of my failure. It is an attempt to build a map for those who are lost. It is a promise to share every step I take from this point forward, so that maybe, just maybe, someone else walking this path will feel a little less alone.

This is my story. And it is far from over.
